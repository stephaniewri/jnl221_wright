 <h1> Why the midterms have made climate activists hopeful for the future </h1>
 <h2>Even with Republicans controlling the House, Democrats retained enough control at the federal level to defend the Inflation Reduction Act while making inroads in crucial local elections.</h2>
 <p><strong>By Denise Chow</strong></p>
 <p>The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/midterm-elections-2022" target="_blank">midterm elections</a> may have resulted in a divided Congress, but environmentalists still saw plenty to celebrate, with wins in several key races that could reshape climate politics in the country over the next few years.</p>
 <p>While a Republican-controlled House likely means it will be more resistant to climate policies, experts said certain election victories — particularly at the state and local level — could be significant in helping the nation reduce emissions and transition away from fossil fuels.</p>
 <p>At the federal level, the Democrats held onto control of the Senate, an outcome that means opponents won’t be able to dismantle President Biden’s sweeping <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/inflation-reduction-act-climate-change-rcna42052" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, which includes hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change.</p>
 <p>The law, passed in August, includes major spending to expand renewable energy production, provide incentives for electric vehicles and clean energy, and prioritize environmental justice initiatives. Its implementation will largely fall to state and local leaders, making wins by Democratic governors in places such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota important, said Caroline Spears, executive director of Climate Cabinet Action, a political action committee that aims to help climate-focused candidates in down-ballot races get elected.</p>
 <p>“You really need leadership in these local areas to execute on the Inflation Reduction Act to the fullest extent,” Spears said. “That is going to take leadership from governors, from state legislatures and public service commissions and state and county officials to get that done.”</p>

 <p>In Minnesota and Michigan, in particular, Democrats now control the governor's office along with both the State Senate and House of Representatives, which means lawmakers in those states will be able to pass new climate laws.</p>
 <p>“In the past few years, there has been incredibly strong climate legislation passed in the Minnesota State House for carbon-free utility standards, greenhouse gas reduction goals, huge environmental justice investment and environmental justice legislation,” Spears said. “They passed the House, but they kept dying in the State Senate. That barrier is gone now.”</p>
 <p>Similar situations, with Democratic control of the governor's seat and both chambers of the state legislature, are also in place now in Massachusetts and Maryland. Massachusetts’ new governor, Maura Healey, also has a history of holding fossil fuel companies accountable. In 2019, as Massachusetts Attorney General, <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-issues-statement-in-response-to-states-highest-court-rejecting-exxons-effort-to-dismiss-climate-deception-lawsuit" target="_blank">Healy sued Exxon Mobil corporation</a> for deceptive advertising to consumers and for misleading investors about the role that fossil fuels play in exacerbating climate change.But some of the biggest changes in climate politics could play out across the Midwest, particularly in places historically dominated by industrial manufacturing, said Daniel Aldana Cohen, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
